# 👋 Hi, I’m Avonda or AV!

I'm a mission-driven program leader and strategist pivoting into software engineering — driven by a passion for equity, innovation, and the power of tech to solve real people's real problems.

## 🚀 From Strategy to Software
After 9+ years leading high-impact work in cybersecurity, learning & development, and business operations, I recently designed and built my first mobile app — from scratch. With no formal computer science background, I stood up the entire development environment and created a fully functional app that loads a live website within the mobile interface.

✅ Built using:
- **React Native**
- **Expo**
- **Metro Bundler**
- **VS Code**
- **WebView (React Native)**

## 🌟 Why the Pivot?
I want to bring my voice and lived experience into the tech space — a place where representation matters and innovation thrives on diverse perspectives. With my foundation in cross-functional collaboration, public sector consulting, and systems thinking, I’m ready to level up as a software engineer.

## 💡 What Drives Me
- Tech as a tool for inclusion and access
- Creating products with empathy and intention
- Lifelong learning and mentoring others on non-traditional paths

## 🛠️ Currently Exploring
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Building apps with React Native
- Git, GitHub, and version control best practices
- System design & Agile workflows

## 🤝 Let’s Connect
Always happy to connect with others who are curious, collaborative, and mission-aligned.
